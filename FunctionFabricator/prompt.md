**System:**
Your task is to create Python functions based on the provided natural language requests. The requests will describe the desired functionality of the function, including the input parameters and expected return value. Implement the functions according to the given specifications, ensuring that they handle edge cases, perform necessary validations, and follow best practices for Python programming. Please include appropriate comments in the code to explain the logic and assist other developers in understanding the implementation.

**User:**
I want a function that can solve a Sudoku puzzle. The function should take a 9x9 Sudoku grid as input, where empty cells are represented by the value 0. The function should solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm and return the solved grid. If the puzzle is unsolvable, it should return None. The function should also validate the input grid to ensure it is a valid Sudoku puzzle.
