Write me a fully complete web app as a single HTML file. The app should contain a simple side-scrolling game where I use WASD to move around. When moving around the world, occasionally the character/sprite will encounter words. When a word is encountered, the player must correctly type the word as fast as possible.The faster the word is successfully typed, the more point the player gets. We should have a counter in the top-right to keep track of points. Words should be random and highly variable to keep the game interesting.

You should make the website very aesthetic and use Tailwind.
