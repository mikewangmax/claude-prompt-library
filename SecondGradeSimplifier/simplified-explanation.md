Every living thing is made up of tiny building blocks called cells. Inside each cell, there are even tinier parts that each have their own job. One of the most important parts is called the **mitochondria**.

You can think of mitochondria like little batteries or power plants inside your cells. Their main job is to make energy! They take in food and oxygen and turn them into something called **ATP**. ATP is a special molecule that works like fuel for the cell.

Imagine ATP is like coins in a video game. The cell needs those coins to do everything -- like growing, moving, and fixing itself. Without enough ATP, the cell would not have the energy to do its work.

So, mitochondria are super important because they keep cells powered up and running. That is why scientists call them the **powerhouses of the cell** -- they are the energy makers that keep everything going!
