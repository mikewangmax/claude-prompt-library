Create a one-page website for an online learning platform called "EduQuest" with the following features and sections:

1. A fixed navigation bar with links to course categories (Math, Science, Languages, Arts) and a search bar.
2. A hero section with a video background showcasing students learning online, a dynamic tagline that rotates between "Learn at your own pace," "Discover new passions," and "Expand your horizons" every 3 seconds, and a "Get Started" button leading to a course catalog.
3. A featured courses section displaying course cards with placeholders for course images, titles, instructors, and descriptions.
4. An interactive "Learning Paths" section with a short quiz to determine learning styles and interests, and a button to start the quiz.
5. A "Success Stories" section featuring testimonials from satisfied students, with placeholders for the testimonial text and student names.
6. A footer with links to the platform's blog, FAQ, privacy policy, and a "Contact Us" button that opens a modal window with a contact form and customer support information.

Include filler placeholder content for the video background, course cards, and testimonials. Embed the CSS styles within the <style> tag in the <head> section and place the JavaScript code within the <script> tag at the end of the <body> section.

The JavaScript code should handle the dynamic tagline in the hero section, rotating through the different taglines every 3 seconds.
