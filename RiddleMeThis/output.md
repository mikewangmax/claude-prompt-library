## Guided Hints

Take your time with each hint before moving on to the next. Try to think through each clue carefully.

### Hint 1
Think about the riddle's structure. It mentions real-world features — cities, mountains, water, roads — but says the usual things you'd find *within* them are absent. What kind of thing could contain all of these features in name only, without the physical reality?

### Hint 2
Consider objects or tools that *represent* the real world rather than *being* the real world. The riddle describes something that depicts geography without any of the living, moving elements that come with it.

### Hint 3
You might find this object in a classroom, a library, or folded up in the glove compartment of a car. It shows you where things are, even though it isn't actually *there* itself.

### Hint 4
This object is flat (or can be folded flat). It uses lines, colors, labels, and symbols to communicate information about the physical world. You might use it to plan a trip or study for a geography exam.

## Solution

**A map.**

## Explanation

A map is a representation of the physical world, and it contains all the features mentioned in the riddle — but only as symbols and labels, not as actual physical things:

- **Cities** — A map marks cities with dots and names, but no houses or people actually live on the map.
- **Mountains** — A map shows mountain ranges through shading, contour lines, or triangular symbols, but no real trees grow on the paper or screen.
- **Water** — A map depicts oceans, rivers, and lakes (often in blue), but no real fish swim in that ink or pixel-rendered water.
- **Roads** — A map traces highways and streets as lines, but no actual cars drive along them.

The key to solving this riddle is recognizing the pattern: every clue pairs a geographical feature with something that would normally exist *within* that feature in the real world, and then denies it. This signals that the answer is something that *represents* geography without embodying it — and the most common everyday object that fits that description is a map.
