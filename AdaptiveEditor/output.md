Arrr, gather 'round ye salty dogs and lend me yer ears! 'Twas the year 1758 when a landlubber by the name o' Carl Linnaeus — a Swedish scallywag who spent his days studyin' plants and beasties instead o' sailin' the seven seas — went and published his grand tome, *Systema Naturae*. In it, the clever bilge rat came up with a two-word namin' system fer all the creatures o' the world (binomial nomenclature, if ye be feelin' fancy). Now, *Canis* be the Latin word fer "dog," savvy? And under that banner, ol' Linnaeus logged the common house dog, the fearsome wolf, and that sneaky golden jackal. Aye, all manner o' four-legged beasts with sharp teeth and a nose fer trouble — not unlike me crew!
