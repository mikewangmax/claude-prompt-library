# Neologism: Cognoscamoflage

**cognoscamoflage** (kɒɡˌnɒskəˈmɑːflɑːʒ) — *noun*

**Definition:** The deliberate act of disguising one's lack of understanding or knowledge about a subject by mimicking the verbal and nonverbal cues of comprehension — such as nodding, saying "right, right," paraphrasing vaguely, or deploying jargon — in order to avoid the social discomfort of appearing ignorant or uninformed.

**Etymology:** A portmanteau of three elements:

- **cognosc-** — from the Latin *cognoscere*, meaning "to learn" or "to know," which also gives us *cognition* and *cognoscenti*
- **camo-** — from *camouflage*, the practice of concealment or disguise
- **-flage** — retaining the ending of *camouflage* to preserve its phonetic elegance

The word thus literally encodes "the camouflaging of one's cognition" — or more precisely, the camouflaging of the *absence* of cognition on a given topic.
