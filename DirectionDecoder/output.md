# How to Make a Cup of Tea

1. Fill a kettle with fresh, cold water and place it on the stove or switch on the electric kettle to bring the water to a boil.

2. While waiting for the water to boil, select a clean mug from your cupboard and place a single tea bag inside it.

3. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, carefully pour the hot water into the mug directly over the tea bag, filling the mug to your desired level. Leave about half an inch of space from the rim to prevent spilling.

4. Allow the tea to steep undisturbed for 2 to 5 minutes, depending on your preferred strength:
   - **Light tea:** 2 minutes
   - **Medium tea:** 3 minutes
   - **Strong tea:** 4 to 5 minutes

5. Remove the tea bag from the mug using a spoon. Gently press the tea bag against the side of the mug with the spoon to extract any remaining flavor, then discard the tea bag.

6. Add milk to the tea in small amounts until the color and taste suit your preference. Start with a splash (about 1 to 2 tablespoons) and adjust from there.

7. Add sugar or sweetener to taste. One teaspoon is a good starting point; stir and taste before adding more.

8. Stir the tea thoroughly with a spoon to combine the milk and sugar evenly throughout the drink.

9. Enjoy your freshly made cup of tea while it is still hot. Be cautious of the temperature when taking your first sip.
