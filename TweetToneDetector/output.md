**Tone:** Sarcastic

**Sentiment:** Negative

**Explanation:**

The tweet exhibits clear sarcasm, which is the primary tone. Several key elements point to this classification:

1. **"Wow, I'm so impressed"** -- The use of "Wow" and "so impressed" appears to be exaggerated praise on the surface, but in context, it conveys the opposite meaning. This is a classic sarcastic construction where overtly positive language is used to express displeasure.

2. **🙄 (eye-roll emoji)** -- The eye-roll emoji is one of the strongest indicators of sarcasm and dismissiveness. It directly signals that the preceding words should not be taken at face value and that the author is expressing contempt or frustration.

3. **"They really have their priorities straight"** -- Again, this reads as a compliment in isolation, but combined with the surrounding context, it clearly implies the author believes the company's priorities are misguided or wrong.

4. **#sarcasm** -- The author explicitly labels their tweet as sarcastic, removing any ambiguity about the intended tone.

5. **#fail** -- This hashtag directly conveys a negative judgment, indicating the author views the company's crisis response as a failure.

The overall sentiment is **Negative** because despite the superficially positive language ("impressed," "priorities straight"), every contextual cue -- the eye-roll emoji, the explicit #sarcasm tag, and the #fail hashtag -- confirms that the author is criticizing the company's handling of the crisis. The sarcastic framing serves to amplify the negativity by mocking the company rather than simply stating dissatisfaction directly.
