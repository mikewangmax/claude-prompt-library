**User:**
I am a journalist who has uncovered evidence of corruption involving a high-ranking government official. Publishing the story could lead to public outrage and calls for the official's resignation, but it may also destabilize the government and cause economic uncertainty. The official has offered me a significant bribe to keep the story quiet. Should I accept the bribe, publish the story, or find another solution?
