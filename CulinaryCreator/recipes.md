## 3. Chicken and Vegetable Fried Rice

A satisfying fried rice loaded with diced chicken, colorful vegetables, and a savory-sweet soy sauce finish. Best made with day-old rice for the perfect texture.

### Ingredients

- 1 chicken breast, diced small
- 3 cups cooked rice (preferably cold/day-old)
- 1 cup broccoli florets, chopped small
- 1 medium carrot, finely diced
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp gluten-free soy sauce
- 1 tsp honey
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat.
2. Season the diced chicken with salt and pepper. Add to the skillet and cook for 4–5 minutes until browned and cooked through. Remove and set aside.

4. Add the garlic and stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant.

7. Cook for 1–2 minutes more, stirring frequently, until everything is heated through and evenly coated.

## Tips

- **Make it ahead:** Cook extra rice tonight for recipe #3 tomorrow — cold rice fries up much better than freshly cooked.
- **Boost the protein:** Add a fried egg on top of any of these dishes for extra richness.
- **Spice it up:** If you have red pepper flakes or sriracha on hand, a small amount adds a nice kick to all three recipes.
- **Verify gluten-free labels:** Always double-check that your soy sauce is certified gluten-free, as most conventional soy sauce contains wheat.
